		<p><center>What would you do if you came across someone on the street that had not had anything to eat for several days?  Would you give that person some food?  Well, the next time you get that feeling you might want to check if it is still legal to feed the homeless where you live.  Sadly, feeding the homeless has been banned in major cities all over America.  Other cities that have not banned it outright have put so many requirements on those that want to feed the homeless (acquiring expensive permits, taking food preparation courses, etc.) that feeding the homeless has become “out of reach” for most average people.  Some cities are doing these things because they are concerned about the “health risks” of the food being distributed by ordinary “do-gooders”.  Other cities are passing these laws because they do not want homeless people congregating in city centers where they know that they will be fed.  But at a time when poverty and government dependence are soaring to unprecedented levels, is it really a good idea to ban people from helping those that are hurting?</p>

		<p>This is just another example that shows that our country is being taken over by control freaks.  There seems to be this idea out there that it is the job of the government to take care of everyone and that nobody else should even try.</p>

		<p>But do we really want to have a nation where you have to get the permission of the government before you do good to your fellow man?</p>

		<p>Homeless shelters all over the nation are turning people away each night because they have no more room.  There are many homeless people that are lucky just to make it through the night alive during the winter.</p>

		<p>Sometimes a sandwich or a cup of warm soup can make a difference for a homeless person.  But many U.S. cities have decided that feeding the homeless is such a threat.</p>

		<p>New York City has banned all food donations to government-run homeless shelters because the bureaucrats there are concerned that the donated food will not be “nutritious” enough.</center></p>
